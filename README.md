# Boltzmann

A python script computing the entropy of Bitcoin transactions and the linkability of their inputs and outputs.

## Usage

`python ludwig.py [--rpc] [--duration=600] [--maxnbtxos=12] [--cjmaxfeeratio=0] [--options=PRECHECK,LINKABILITY,MERGE_FEES,MERGE_INPUTS,MERGE_OUTPUTS] [--txids=8e56317360a548e8ef28ec475878ef70d1371bee3526c017ac22ad61ae5740b8,812bee538bd24d03af7876a77c989b2c236c063a5803c720769fc55222d36b47,...]`

[-t OR --txids] = List of txids to be processed.

[-p OR --rpc] = Use bitcoind's RPC interface as source of blockchain data

[-T OR --testnet] = Use testnet3 as source of blockchain data

[-s OR --smartbit] = Use Smartbit as source of blockchain data

[-d OR --duration] = Maximum number of seconds allocated to the processing of a single transaction.
                     Default value is 600 seconds.

[-x OR --maxnbtxos] = Maximum number of inputs or ouputs.
                      Transactions with more than maxnbtxos inputs or outputs are not processed.
                      Default value is 12.    

[-r OR --cjmaxfeeratio] = Max intrafees paid by the taker of a coinjoined transaction.
                          Expressed as a percentage of the coinjoined amount.

[-o OR --options] = Options to be applied during processing.
                    Default value is PRECHECK, LINKABILITY, MERGE_INPUTS.
                    Available options are :

- PRECHECK = Checks if deterministic links exist without processing the entropy of the transaction. Similar to Coinjoin Sudoku by K.Atlas.

- LINKABILITY = Computes the entropy of the transaction and the txos linkability matrix.

- MERGE_INPUTS = Merges inputs "controlled" by a same address. Speeds up computations.

- MERGE_OUTPUTS = Merges outputs "controlled" by a same address. Speeds up computations but this option is not recommended.

- MERGE_FEES = Processes fees as an additional output paid by a single participant. May speed up computations.


## Troubleshooting

This project requires python 3. If your default `python` points to python 2, substitute `python3` for all instructions in this README.

MERGE_OUTPUTS option is still a work in progress. Results are not always reliable.

MERGE_FEES should only be used if it is known with certainty that all mining fees were paid by a single partificant to the transaction. Not recommended to use, especillay in the case of Stonewall/Stonewallx2 transactions.

If your request is returning no response and you only see "DEBUG: Using remote blockchain.info API" make sure you are typing the commands correctly. 

## Data Sources

You can use the remote Blockchain.info API for blockchain data (default), bitcoind's local RPC interface using the `--rpc` command line option, or write your own wrapper.

In order to use bitcoind's RPC interface, you must set these environment variables:
* BOLTZMANN_RPC_USERNAME
* BOLTZMANN_RPC_PASSWORD
* BOLTZMANN_RPC_HOST
* BOLTZMANN_RPC_PORT

Ex. `$ export BOLTZMANN_RPC_USERNAME=myusername`

You will also need to enable full indexing for bitcoind. This consumes more storage space. See this sample excerpt of a `bitcoin.cfg` file:
```
# You must set rpcuser and rpcpassword to secure the JSON-RPC api
rpcuser=myusername
rpcpassword=mysecretpassword_REPLACE_ME
rpcport=8332

#Maintain a full transaction index, used by the getrawtransaction rpc call (default: 0)
txindex=1
```

## Contributing

Many improvements are needed:
 - smarter heuristics to manage intra fees paid/received by participants to coinjoin markets (e.g. joinmarket, ...)
 - optimization of the algorithm (parallelization, memorization, ...)
 - ...
